# Pepperspray
A women's safety mobile Application.

*Pepperspray* is a women's safety mobile App built on the the [Universal Windows Platform!](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/develop/)
It is distinguished from the lot, as it is able to 'instinctively' percieve if the user is in duress and can automatically alert the predefined emergency contacts with the current user's location. Unlike other safety apps which pose an improbable requirement of retrieving your phone, opening an app and calling for help. Pepperspray works without any manual intervention.

It uses Azure cognitice services and text analytics to extract key phraes from unstructured text, categorize them into relevant buckets and score the underlying sentiment from the spoken text. More info [here!](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/#features)

It uses innovative ways of conveying and achieving more while doing and demanding less:
- Voice activated distress signal    
- Senses emotion and sends message automatically to emergency contacts   
- Provides nearby locations of crowded areas(_beta_)
- Changes lock screen color from red to green as the emergency contact reaches closer to your location
- Uses Universal Windows App features, therefore notification for help is received and pushed to all Windows devices
